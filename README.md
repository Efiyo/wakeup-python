# wakeup-python
Simple Python script to send a magic packet to another MAC address on your network to wake the PC at a specific time daily.

Just edit line #6 with the MAC address of the PC you want to wake-up and line #10 to modify scheduling

The script best works if left to work in the background on an SBC like the Raspberry Pi using screen and making a crontab entry
